## 1. INTRODUCTION

a. The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present
suggestions for inciting and executing it.

b. Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially
trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is
primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is
executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with
an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and
reprisal.

c. Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any
other materials he might normally be expected to
possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile,
his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and
inconspicuous access in everyday life.

d. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by
highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative
attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one
spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an
unpleasant situation among one's fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.

e. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the "human clement," is frequently responsible for accidents, delays,
and general obstruction eveb under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty
decisions and non-cooperation are normally found in his kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to
enlarge that "margin for error."

#### (a) Organizations and Conferences

(1) Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.

(2) Make "speeches." Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes
and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate "patriotic" comments.

(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the
committees as large as possible - never less than five.

(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.

(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.

(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of
that decision,

(7) Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might
result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.

(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision - raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies
within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.

- (j) Boycott all movies, entertainments, concerts, newspapers which are in any way connected with the quisling
  authorities.
- (k) Do not cooperate in salvage schemes.
