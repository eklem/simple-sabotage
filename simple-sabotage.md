## Foreword

Office of Strategic Services
Washington, D.C.
17 January 1944

This Simple Sabotage Field Manual - Strategic Services (Provisional) - is published for the information and guidance of
all concerned and will be used as the basic doctrine for Strategic Services training for this subject.

The contents of this Manual should be carefully controlled and should not be allowed to come into unauthorized
hands.

The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be
distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special
cases and as directed by the theater commander.

AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual.

William J. Donovan
Director
